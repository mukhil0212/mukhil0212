- **Data & infra:** PostgreSQL (schema design, optimization), Docker, CI/CD, cloud deployments

## Selected projects
- **Sentinel-RAG** — IaC security scanning & autofix assistant (Checkov/tflint + agent-driven edits)
- **FinanceTracker** — expense tracking w/ AI spending analysis + OAuth (shipped, used by friends)

**Frontend:** React, Next.js, TypeScript  
**Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Node.js  
**Data/Infra:** PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, CI/CD, DigitalOcean, AWS EC2
